<body>This page is the root of the javadoc hierarchy for the Deceptive Detection Frontier Finder tool. It includes command-line and graphics interfaces.

<h2>What is the Frontier Finder?</h2>
<p>The Frontier Finder's main function is as follows: given a list of
sensors, compute an "extremal frontier" for the set of all policies
based on these sensors. The frontier is a set of policies that defines
a "convex hull" of the set of all feasible policies in the
(policy_cost, detection_rate) plane. That is, for any conceivable
policy p there is a policy p' whose cost is the same as that of p,
whose detection rate is the same or better than p, and which either is
a one of the frontier policies, or is a linear combination ("mix") of
two frontier policies.

<p>Each sensor is described by its cost and its ROC curve. A basic
assumption of the Frontier Finder (something that only rarely holds in
real life) is that all sensors are completely independent: that is, if
one looks at all bad policies as a group, there is no correlation
between their "grading" by one test and their "grading" by any other
test. The same goes for all good policies.


<h2>Getting started with Frontier Finder API</h2>

<p>This document will help you getting started with using Deceptive
Detection Frontier Finder API in your application.</p>

<h3>Dataflow overview</h3>

<p>One would usually use the Frontier Finder API in the following way:

<ol>
<li>Create a list of {@link dd.engine.Test} objects representing
sensors that one wish to combine into policies.

<li>Specify any required frontier generation options by creating a 
{@link dd.engine.FrontierContext} object.

<li>Run the Frontier Finder, which will generate a {@link
dd.engine.Frontier} object (or, in the case of a non-zero pi, an array
of Frontier objects) describing the extremal frontier. The method to
use is {@link dd.engine.Frontier#buildFrontier(Test[],
FrontierContext, int, Vector)} for pi=0, or {@link
dd.engine.Frontier#buildFrontiersMultiPi(double[], Test[], FrontierContext, int maxDepth)} for
non-zero pi.

<li>Extract desired information (e.g., policy trees) from the a {@link
dd.engine.Frontier} object(s) returned. 

</ol>
