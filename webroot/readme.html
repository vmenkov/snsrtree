Deceptive Detection Policy Frontier Finder: User's Guide
</h1>

<h2><a name="pre">Prerequisites</a></h2>

<h3>Necessary</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Java 1.6 on a Linux/UNIX or (hopefully) MS Windows machine.
<li>
Batik SVG Toolkit (see below)
</ul>

<h3>Desirable</h3>

<ul>
<li>
Apache Ant: to facilitate compilation/deployment
<li>
Apache Tomcat: only needed to run the web front end
<li>
Apache Commons libraries: commons-fileupload-1.2.1.jar and
commons-io-1.4.jar : to compile for the web front end
</ul>

<h3>Batik SVG Toolkit</h3>
<p>
The Deceptive Detection Policy Frontier Finder uses the Batik SVG Toolkit to
produce image files, or to convert image files from SVG format to JPG or PNG
formats. It is a free Apache product.

<p>
To make sending the distribution file by email, as well as later updating,
easier, I don't include the Batik kit into it. Instead, please download the
file batik-1.7.zip from <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/download.cgi">the download page</a>.

<p>
You then need to extract the files from that archive to some directory on
your computer; on a Linux host, it can be done with
<pre>
     cd some_directory
     unzip batik-1.7.zip
</pre>
This will have the subdirectoy "some_directory/batik-1.7" under the directory
where you have started.

<p>
There are various ZIP tools installed on most MS Windows machine as well.

<h2><a name="zip">Installing from a ZIP file</a></h2>

<p>
If you have access to Sakai, and don't plan to do development work, it
may be easiest from you to install the application from the ZIP file
distributed at Sakai.

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Choose what directory you plan to install the Frontier Finder and
the necessary libraries in. For the rest of the discussion, we'll
assume that the directory (the "main directory") is called "dndo":
<pre>
       mkdir dndo
</pre>

<li>Install Batik. As per instructions in seciton 1, download the Batik
zip file and unpack it, so that batik-1.7 will be a subdirectory of
your main directory:
<pre>
     cd dndo
     unzip batik-1.7.zip
</pre>

<li> Download the distribution file for the current version of the
Frontier Finder (e.g. snsrtree-v1_8_0.zip) from Sakai, and extract it
into the main directory:
<pre>
      cd dndo
      unzip snsrtree-v1_8_0.zip
</pre>
This way, your main directory will have a subdirectory for Batik and a subdirectory for Snsrtree, e.g.
<pre>
     dndo/batik-1.7
</pre>
and
<pre>
     dndo/snsrtree
</pre>
It does not have to be done in this way, but if you install DD and Batik in 
under different directories, you'd have to modify the classpath settings when
runing our DD application.

<li>You don't need to recompile the Java program, since the code has
been already compiled, and a Jar file is included in the
distribution. Should you modify code in some way and need to
recompile, you can do it by runing 
<pre>
	   ant compile
</pre>
in the directory "snsrtree"      	  
</ol>
</p>

<h2><a name="google">Installing from Google Code</a></h2>

<p>
An alternative process for installing the application is by
downloading its source code from the repository at
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/snsrtree/">http://code.google.com/p/snsrtree/</a>, and then recompiling it yourself.

<p>
Assuming that your "main" directory is called "dndo", 
you can check out the code from the repository as follows:
<pre>
    cd dndo
    svn checkout https://snsrtree.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ snsrtree-read-only
</pre>

<p>
You will also need to download the Batik toolkit (see above), and unpack it into
a subdirectory of your main directory:
<pre>
    cd dndo
    unzip batik-1.7.zip
</pre>

<p>
Finally, you will also need to download two jar files from Apache web
site (commons-fileupload-1.2.1.jar from
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/">
http://commons.apache.org/fileupload/ </a>, and commons-io-1.4.jar from
<a href="http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_io.cgi">
http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_io.cgi </a>) and
to install these jar files into snsrtree/lib :
<pre>
    cd dndo
    cd snsrtree
    mkdir lib
</pre>
(The Apache site may distribute Jar files not individually, but
packaged with other files into ZIP of TAR.GZ files; you'd need to
unpack those, and place the extracted jar files into snsrtree/lib).

<p>
Once everything is installed, you can run
<pre>
    ant compile
</pre>
in the snsrtree directory.

<h2><a name="gui">Running the GUI program</a></h2>

<p>
In UNIX, run this script in the directory "snsrtree":
<pre>
./run.sh
</pre>
In MS Windows, run "run.bat".

<p>
If the program fails during file-writing stage because it cannot find the
Batik classes, it means that relative location of the batik-1.7 directory
and the dd directory is not what it was expected to be. Move one of the
directories, or modify run.sh in accordance with their actual location.

<h3>Reading the sensor list</h3>

Use the "File | Read Config File" menu item to read a config file in the same
format as used by your old application. This config file is simply the list of
sensor files, one file name per line. Each sensor file described a single
sensor, in the format specified by Paul and used by your old application

<h3>Computing</h3>

Use the "Run | Compute frontier" menu item to compute the efficient frontier
for the currently loaded set of sensors. It will take some time; you can watch
the standard output (command line window) for the progress. Once the frontier
has been computed, it will be plotted on the screen in the (Cost,
DetectionRate) coordinates. The cost for each policy includes the stochastic
cost of all tests and final inspections involved.

<h3> Saving as text </h3>

You can save results as text using the "File | Save frontier" menu

<h3> Saving as an image file </h3>

<p>
You can save results as an image file (SVG, JPG, or PNG) using the "File |
Write frontier" menu. The output file format will be determined by the
extension of the file name you have specified (.svg, .jpg, or .png).

<p>
What format to use? SVG is the recommended format, as it's a vector
format (i.e., perfectly scalable and lossless). An SVG image can
always be converted to JPG or PNG later on, with Batik utilities (and
probably to PostScript too); it can be viewed in good web browsers,
such as Firefox. Nonetheless, you can also save a graph directly as an
image in PNG or JPG format, if this makes your life easier.

<h3> Saving approximated sensors </h3>

<p>
Since ver 1.6.2, <em> eps</em> is applied to original sensors, replacing them
with "approximated" sensors, by merging some "thin" channels
("thinner" than eps in both C and D dimensions) into wider ones.

<p>
The description of the approximated sensors can be saved using the
"File | Save sensors" menu item. You will then will need to pick an
existing or new directory into which the data files will be saved. For
each sensor, two files will be saves:
<ul>
<li> a sensor description file, describing the approximated sensor's ROC
   curve, in the same format as used in the input files for the
   original sensors.

<li> a "map" file, showing the what channel(s) of the original sensor each
   channel of the approximated channel corresponds to. For a 5-channel
   approximated sensor corresponding to an original 15-channel sensor,
   the map file may look as follows:
<pre>
   0 3
   1 5 
   2 6
   3 10
   4 14
</pre>
   This means that channel 0 of the approximated sensor is obtained by
   merging channels 0-3 of the original sensor, channel 1 is obtained by
   merging channels 4-5, channel 2 is the original channel 6, and so on.
</ul>
</p>

<h3> Viewing policies </h3>

<p>
Once a frontier has been computed and displayed on the screen, you can click a
mouse button on any of the red circles representing policies. A menu will pop
up, displaying basic info about the policy, and giving you an entry for
plotting the decision tree of the policy. If you choose that entry, the
decision tree for the chosen policy will be plotted in a separate new window.

<h2><a name="batch">Running the command-line program</a></h2>

You can also run the frontier computation without the GUI, purely as a batch
job. E.g.
<pre>
./batch-run.sh config.txt
</pre>
or
<pre>
time java -classpath classes dd.engine.Main config.txt
</pre>
(The "time" command preceding the "java" program name, and also included in
bath0run.sh, provides for some runtime statistics from the UNIX shell - the
user and system time, as well as wall-clock time, for the run)

<h2><a name="svg">Converting SVG files to JPG or PNG</a></h2>
<p>
If you are producing image files for importing into a document preparation
system with PostScript or PDF output, such as LaTeX, SVG format is probably
more suitable than JPG or PNG, because SVG is a vector format (and not a
raster, i.e. bitmap, format as the other two), and SVG images can be scaled
perfectly, without aliasing problems or quality loss. SVG files can also be
viewed directly in many web browsers, such as modern versions of Firefox, or
uploaded to image archive sites such as Wikipedia / Wikimedia Commons.

<p>
Nonetheless, you may need to convert an SVG file to JPG or PNG. The Batik SVG
toolkit, which you have installed already, includes a tool for this. It can be
used as follows.

<p>
To convert test.svg to test.png:
<pre>
      java -jar ../batik-1.7/batik-rasterizer.jar test.svg 
</pre>
To convert test.svg to test.jpg, using default quality:
<pre>
      java -jar ../batik-1.7/batik-rasterizer.jar -m image/jpeg test.svg 
</pre>
Same, with 80% quality:
<pre>
      java -jar ../batik-1.7/batik-rasterizer.jar -m image/jpeg -q 0.8 test.svg 
</pre>

<p>
More details on conversion (including dealing with multiple files at once) can
be found here:
<a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/rasterizer.html">
http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/tools/rasterizer.html</a>

<p>
There is also script "svg2jpg.sh" in the directory dd that you can use:
<pre>
./svg2jpg.sh test.svg test.jpg
</pre>
